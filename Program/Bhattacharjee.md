### Invited Talk:  **System Requirements for Deep Learning Foundational Models**

### [Slides]()

**Abstract:**

Foundational Models are creating a deep impact on many applications areas of Deep Learning.  This includes language, security, biomedical, code etc.  Training these models is very computation intensive and can consume even weeks on a large distributed system. Besides training, inference with these models can also be a challenge due to their high latency.  In this talk I will describe the challenges posed in training and inferring with large foundational models with special emphasis on language models and what an efficient system would look like.
