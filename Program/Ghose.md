### Invited Talk:  *Using Processing-in-Memory to Accelerate Edge Machine Learning*

### [Slides]()

**Abstract:**

Machine learning (ML) is often thought of as a computationally intensive workload, and there has been much work focusing on how to accelerate the core computation of ML algorithms. However, as ML models grow in complexity, their model footprints exceed the limited storage capacity of many accelerators. In this talk, we will start by exploring the performance of and bottlenecks associated with edge neural network (NN) models, discussing the results of a detailed characterization that we conducted. Then, we will discuss how the memory system plays an outsized role in these bottlenecks, and will explore two types of processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures (Mensa and RACER) that can alleviate these bottlenecks. As we will show, both Mensa and RACER offer alternatives to conventional monolithic ML accelerators, and in doing so significantly improve the performance and energy consumption of edge NN model inference.
