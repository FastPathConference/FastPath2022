### Invited Talk:  *Machine Learning for Better Medicine*

### [Slides](https://fastpathconference.github.io/FastPath2022/Program/FastPath2022_Yuan_Luo.pdf)

**Abstract:**

This talk will discuss some of the broad efforts at the Luo Lab at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.  The Lab is exploring Multi-modal Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Vision/Image Processing, Natural Language Processing, Fairness, Transparency, Bias, and more.  Some of our recent work applies multi-modal machine learning to better understand complex diseases, target therapies, improve patient outcomes, and reduce bias in health care. The common theme of these works aims at building AI/ML models that improve both prediction accuracy and interpretability.  We will also share our vision on how ML needs to evolve itself with hardware advancement in order to better assist medical applications.
